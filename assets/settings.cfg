    //pic_dir specifies the folder that the KerbalX mod will load and save pictures to.
    //Saving pictures only applies when using the mod interface to grab a picture of a craft in the editors, 
    //it DOES NOT effect where KSP will save pictures when pressing F1.
    //By default this is set to the Screenshots folder inside your KSP install, but you can change this location to where ever you like.
    //To set the path to somewhere inside your KSP install use <ksp_install> as the root of the path.
    //To set the path to a location outside your KSP install use the full path. You can use either windows (\) or linux (/) file separators (linux style is preferable).
