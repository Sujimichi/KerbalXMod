In either the SPH or VAB, load a craft and then click the upload icon in the toolbar.  From there you can add some pictures and click upload.  
If it's a craft you've already uploaded the interface will automatically switch to update mode and select the matching craft on the site. Click update to update the craft on the site with the one loaded.  You can change which craft will be updated frmo the dropdown menu.
